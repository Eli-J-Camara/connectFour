# Connect Four

### Development Plan
1. Build the layout using css and html.
    * Display red/black disc ✓
    * Stack discs using flex box 
    * Create board made of seven columns ✓
2. Add functionality to the game.
    * Add discs with a click handler function attached to each column❗️
    * Alternate black and white discs 
    * console.log() the position after each move to keep track of what color disc is at each position
3. Stop adding discs when column full/check for four in a row
    * Use an if statement to block a column from being clicked if that column is full ✓
    * Use a four loop with if statements within each click handler that checks the cells in each direction that are the same as it ✓(Check out Lesson on Nested Arrays)

### Questions
1. Why isn't our editModel function working?
2. Is our tie function working properly?
